# CoDB â€“ Commodum DB

## Yet another database library or not invented here
This is an achived copy of my own database framework.

It's like a PEAR_DB / MDB2. It was a great idea back in the days.
I liked it, it was used in 10+ different projects during 2010-2013.

I don't remember why PEAR libs was not good.


## The Story 
Back in 2009 me and my friend decided to create new CMS and later, in 2010, it's become a framework.

New framework was a big step for us, we were working hard to make it best. 

There are were plenty frameworks in 2010, yes. We could choose one and contribute, yes.

It's obvious now, but it was such a dream for us! 

Maybe, not sure though, we thought that the mew framework can't work with old libraries such as PEAR.

## Fetures
Basically CoDB is a simple database wrapper with built-in hydration, schema manipulation.

CoDB wrapper has macros for multi-lingual fields, database prefixes.

Later, in 2012, I've added XML-database schema support for creation and altering database.

Latest framework versions had an ORM feature and models. This XML schema was for framework ORM.


## Long story short
I've switched to Doctrine
